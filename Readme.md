## Database setup

## Prerequisites
- MySQL Server installed on your system.

## Steps to Set Up Employee Database

### 1. Create Database Schema
named 'employee_db'.

### 2. Create Employees Table
Run the following SQL command to create the `employees` table within the `employee_db` schema:

```sql
-- create table
CREATE TABLE `employee_db`.`employees` (
  `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `employee_code` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `salary` int DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=0 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```

### Don't forget to add this below store procedure into your database stored-procedure option inside your database.

```
-- stored procedure - execute withing create procedure window
CREATE PROCEDURE `employee_db`.`usp_employee_add_or_edit` (
IN _id INT,
IN _name VARCHAR(45),
IN _employee_code VARCHAR(45),
IN _salary INT

)
BEGIN
	IF _id = 0 THEN
		INSERT INTO employees(name,employee_code,salary)
		VALUES (_name,_employee_code,_salary);
        
	ELSE
		UPDATE employees
        SET name = _name,
		employee_code = _employee_code,
        salary = _salary
        WHERE id = _id;
	END IF;
    
    SELECT ROW_COUNT() AS 'affectedRows';
END
```

## Table Structure

| Field          | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
|----------------|--------------|------|-----|---------|----------------|
| id             | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name           | varchar(45)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| employee_code  | varchar(45)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| salary         | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |                |

### Notes
- The `id` field is the primary key and will auto-increment with each new record.
- You can customize the table structure based on your specific requirements.

## API Reference

### Employee API's

#### Retrieve all employees

- **Response**: Returns a JSON array of all employees.

  ```
  {
  "employees": [
      {

      "name": "Erina nakiri",
      "employee_code": "EMP008",
      "salary": 400000
      },
      {
      "id": 11,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "employee_code": "EMP003",
      "salary": 80000
      }
  ]
  }

  ```

#### Retrieve an employee by ID

- **Endpoint**: `GET http:/localhost:3004/api/employees/:{add_employee_id}`

  ```
  {
  "employee": {
      "id": 9,
      "name": "Erina nakiri",
      "employee_code": "EMP008",
      "salary": 400000
  }
  }
  ```

- **Response**: Returns a JSON object of the employee with the specified ID.

#### Delete an employee by ID

# Employee Management API Tests

The API is designed to manage employee data, providing endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting employee records.

## Dependencies

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version x.x.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version x.x.x)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (version x.x.x)
- [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) (version x.x.x)
- [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) (version x.x.x)

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Important Note: Database Connection

_**⚠️ The tests in this suite operate on a real-time MySQL database connection. Before running the tests, it's crucial to ensure that the database is properly set up, and any required values for testing (such as employee IDs) are known. ( Please look at the table and it will be more easy to adjust the employee Id's ), and please look into current written test cases and there ids to get idea how to adjust⚠️**_

## Running Tests

To execute the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests cover various scenarios for the Employee Management API, including:

- Retrieving all employees.
- Retrieving an employee by ID.
- Deleting an employee by ID.
- Adding a new employee.
- Handling conflicts when adding an employee with an existing employee_code.
- Updating an existing employee.

## Sample Test Output

Running the test suite should produce output similar to the following:

![Alt text](image-1.png)

# Important Notice

**Attention: If you have run the test cases before, follow these instructions carefully!**

If you've previously executed the test cases, it's crucial to update the test case IDs according to the `(NOTE)` provided at the bottom of the test file. Failure to do so will result in the following error:

### Instructions for Updating Test Cases

1. Open the test file in your preferred code editor.
2. Locate the `(NOTE)` section at the bottom of the `(employee.tests.js)` file.
3. Update each test case ID according to the provided guidelines.
4. Save the changes.

By ensuring that the test case IDs match the specified format, you'll avoid encountering errors during testing. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

## This how test cases looks if you dont update (id) after each (test run)

## Troubleshooting Tests

If you encounter issues running the tests, try the following steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`).
2. Check your Node.js and npm versions.
3. Verify the correctness of your environment variables for connecting to the MySQL database.
